# React Counter App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates a counter component. The app imports a custom `Counter` component, displays it within the main `App` component, and uses styling from an external CSS file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-counter-app.git
   cd react-counter-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

The `Counter` component is rendered by the `App` component. Once the application is running, you'll be able to interact with the counter functionality (e.g., incrementing or decrementing a value if these features are implemented in `Counter`).
